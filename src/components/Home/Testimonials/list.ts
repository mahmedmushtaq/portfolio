    review:
      "Ahmed has a very strong background in ReactJS and anything javascript related. He is solid skills in tackling new challenges. He took on some quite difficult JS/React tasks, such as implementing a lexical editor (new poorly documented editor by facebook for react), and did a solid job implementing it in an efficient manner on the front end. I would highly recommend him for any Javascript or React task.",
